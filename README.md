### Tyler Tang
Hello,

1. Nothing real/serious but I have dabbled around a decent bit. I'd say i know Python the best of any of the big languages
2. Computer science is something quite interesting to me
3. Some other interests are Engineering and Video Games.
4. Just simply broaden my coding knowledge so I dont have to look as many things up online while coding.
